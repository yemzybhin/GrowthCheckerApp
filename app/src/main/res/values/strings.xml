    <string name="summary">Addictions can sometimes be very hard to break.
Often times breaking them alone always prove abortive.
Hence, there is every need for help and support either from
trusted people or useful materials.
We find it hard to communicate what we
are going through with others due to certain reasons
which mostly could be the fear of being ridiculed.  Well,
this was thought through and the Growth checker
app was developed for this reason and others.
When dealing with addictions, a better sense of accountability
 helps to better deal with the situation. This summarizes what this
app is all about. Days of involvement in the addiction in question
lead to subtraction of very high points and days of non involvement
plus doing certain activities which will help with growth leads to
the addition of positive points. All these are plotted on graphs for
better visualization of growth on a daily basis.
The essence of this app is to serve as a companion throughout
the breaking free period. </string>
